Browser in Haskell
==================
This is a course project for CS653:Functional Programming.  
First step is to fetch external content. For this `Network.HTTP` module will suffice.  
For html rendering, right now I am using `Graphics.UI.Gtk.WebKit`.  
Next step would be to integrate various features available in `HTTP` package to our project.
